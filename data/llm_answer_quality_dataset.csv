1,"What is the purpose of an evaluation framework when working with LLMs?","An evaluation framework helps measure the quality of model outputs, detect regressions, and compare versions consistently.","good","Correct and relevant."
2,"Explain overfitting in simple terms.","Overfitting happens when a model memorizes the training data but performs poorly on new data.","good","Accurate and concise."
3,"Why do we use a train/test split in machine learning?","Because we need one part of the data to train the model and another part to check if it generalizes.","good","Correct reasoning."
4,"What are the main steps of the TF-IDF algorithm?","TF-IDF counts how often words appear, adjusts for how common they are across documents, and turns text into weighted vectors.","good","High-level correct explanation."
5,"Give one example of when you should use a decision tree.","A decision tree is useful when you want an interpretable model that explains decisions from conditions.","good","Good, clear explanation."
6,"Explain what an MCP Server is and what it provides.","An MCP Server exposes structured tools and data to LLMs through a standardized interface, allowing models to interact with external systems safely.","good","Correct and domain-relevant."
7,"Why is rate limiting important in APIs?","Rate limiting prevents abuse, protects backend resources, and ensures fair usage across clients.","good","Accurate and complete."
8,"What is the difference between precision and recall?","Precision measures how many of the predicted positives are correct, while recall measures how many actual positives were found.","good","Standard correct definition."
9,"Describe a situation where a model might hallucinate.","A model might hallucinate when asked about nonexistent facts or when it's forced to answer with low confidence.","good","Accurate explanation."
10,"Explain the concept of 'feature importance' in machine learning.","Feature importance shows which variables have the most influence on a model's predictions.","good","Correct and clear."
11,"What are embeddings used for?","Embeddings represent text or items as vectors so we can compare them semantically.","good","Accurate summary."
12,"What is the purpose of a vector database?","A vector database stores embeddings and lets you search for similar items efficiently.","good","Correct purpose."
13,"What is a token bucket and how does it work?","A token bucket assigns tokens to users at a fixed rate; each request consumes a token, limiting usage.","good","Accurate and aligned with known definition."
14,"Explain supervised learning to a 10-year-old.","It's like learning from examples: you show a model lots of questions with the right answers so it can learn to answer new ones.","good","Simple, clear, correct."
15,"How does a support vector machine separate classes?","An SVM finds a boundary (hyperplane) that maximizes the margin between two classes.","good","Technically accurate."
16,"What is a regression task in machine learning?","Regression predicts a number, like price or temperature, instead of a category.","good","Clear definition."
17,"How does an LLM evaluation help detect regressions?","By comparing answers across versions, evaluations reveal drops in quality or consistency.","good","Accurate."
18,"Why can't we fully trust model outputs without monitoring?","Models can drift, hallucinate, or degrade in performance, so monitoring ensures reliability.","good","Accurate risk description."
19,"What is the difference between accuracy and F1-score?","Accuracy measures correct predictions overall; F1-score balances precision and recall for imbalanced data.","good","Correct and important distinction."
20,"Explain one risk of exposing proprietary statistics through an API.","If not secured, an API might leak sensitive business data to unauthorized users.","good","Relevant and correct."

21,"What is the purpose of an evaluation framework when working with LLMs?","Evaluation frameworks don't matter much today because models are already smart enough to judge themselves.","bad","Incorrect and misleading."
22,"Explain overfitting in simple terms.","Overfitting is when the model doesn't learn anything and performs poorly everywhere.","bad","Wrong; describes underfitting."
23,"Why do we use a train/test split in machine learning?","Train/test split is optional these days because neural networks already generalize well.","bad","Incorrect claim."
24,"What are the main steps of the TF-IDF algorithm?","TF-IDF is basically just putting text into a database and counting stuff.","bad","Oversimplified and inaccurate."
25,"Give one example of when you should use a decision tree.","Decision trees are best when you have millions of features and want deep neural-network-level accuracy.","bad","Untrue and misleading."
26,"Explain what an MCP Server is and what it provides.","An MCP Server is a microchip that controls motors in industrial factories.","bad","Totally incorrect."
27,"Why is rate limiting important in APIs?","Rate limiting is only used to slow down users so companies can sell premium packages.","bad","Misleading and cynical."
28,"What is the difference between precision and recall?","Precision is how precise you feel, and recall is how much you remember over time.","bad","Confuses technical terms with human memory."
29,"Describe a situation where a model might hallucinate.","Models hallucinate only when the GPU is overheating.","bad","Factually incorrect."
30,"Explain the concept of 'feature importance' in machine learning.","Feature importance means you only keep the features you personally like.","bad","Nonsensical explanation."
31,"What are embeddings used for?","Embeddings are used for drawing pictures from text prompts.","bad","Incorrect use-case."
32,"What is the purpose of a vector database?","A vector database is just a normal SQL table with images in it.","bad","Wrong definition."
33,"What is a token bucket and how does it work?","A token bucket is literally a bucket where tokens are stored and counted manually.","bad","Misinterprets the algorithm literally."
34,"Explain supervised learning to a 10-year-old.","Supervised learning is when teachers watch students so they don't cheat.","bad","Confuses the metaphor."
35,"How does a support vector machine separate classes?","SVMs use clusters to group points and pick the maximum tree path.","bad","Incorrect concepts."
36,"What is a regression task in machine learning?","Regression is what happens when a model gets worse over time.","bad","Wrong definition."
37,"How does an LLM evaluation help detect regressions?","LLM evaluations aren't really needed because models never regress.","bad","Factually false."
38,"Why can't we fully trust model outputs without monitoring?","We can trust them fully if we use a large enough context window.","bad","Incorrect and unsafe claim."
39,"What is the difference between accuracy and F1-score?","They are basically the same metric with different names.","bad","Incorrect."
40,"Explain one risk of exposing proprietary statistics through an API.","There is no real risk because statistics are not considered sensitive data.","bad","Factually wrong and unsafe."
